# Compiler_FLAGS:
#	-Wall				Enables additional compiler warnings
#	-Wextra				Further enables addionational compiler warnings not included by -Wall
#	-Werror				Treat warnings as errors
#	-Wl,--start-group  	The wrong order of gcc parameters can cause no errors/warnings and the resulting compiled file
#						  to be incorrect/broken. Supposedly, adding the -Wl,--start-group flag will fix this
#	-std=gnu99			Sets what language standard is used. gnu99: GNU dialect of ISO C99
#	-g					Enables debugging symbols
#	-O3:				Optimization more for code size and execution time
GLOBAL_CFLAGS=-g -Wall -Wextra -fPIC -Werror -Wl,--start-group -O3
